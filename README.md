## introduction to css

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) define the styles of HTML elements, ie. the way they are displayed visually on screen, including text, colour, layout, and even animation. CSS was created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to offer an external file for styles instead of injecting style formatting within html elements as an attribute (which was long, expensive, and difficult to read for large website developers!)

### goal of this starter kit

For hackers new to building websites and would like to build a website from scratch, CSS is essential to creating a website identity beyond the barebone content described by the html elements. In this starter kit, you will learn basic css properties and how to write a css file that stylizes another file with html elements with an interactive React app demo. This demo is React-beginner friendly, but you can check out the React starter-kit for a more in-depth understanding.

### how does css work?

The structure of a css file looks something like:
> selector {
>    property: value
>    property: value
>    property: value
>}

What is a selector?
It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. For example, "h1" is a selector.
